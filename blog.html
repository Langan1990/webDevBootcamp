		A happy cloud. Every day I learn. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

	<p>I thought today we would do a happy little picture. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet.</p>

	<p>See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Use what you see, don't plan it. We can fix anything. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.
	</p>

	<p>If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun.</p>

	<p>We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Let's have a little bit of fun today. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.</p>
<p>Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Don't fiddle with it all day.</p>

<p>It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. Have fun with it. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. Every time you practice, you learn more. The least little bit can do so much.</p>
